#TrainRoutes Program 

## Summary

Program is designed to analyze a one way train station.  Given a directed graph where each node represents a town and an edge is a
route connecting the two towns.  Each edge is weighted to represent the distance between the towns.  With the given input the program can compute the distance/existence of a specific route, the shortest possible rotue between two towns,  along with the number of possible trips between two towns with a maximum or exact number of possible stops.
